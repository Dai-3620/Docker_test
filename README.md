# Docker_test
A simple demonstration of CI/CD workflow using Github Actions, Docker and Render. This project showcases how to automate building, containerizing and deploying a web application.
## Basic workflow
GitHub Actions → Docker Hub → Render.com
## Short Summary
### Whenever a commit is pushed:
- Github Actions builds and containerizes the app
- The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub
- Render fetches the latest image and deploys it as a live service
## Tech Stack
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- Docker & Docker Hub (Containerization)
- Render.com (Deployment)
